## Scalable, Maintainable Architecture

SpeakShip is built with a **feature-based folder structure** for both frontend and backend, ensuring maximum scalability, maintainability, and developer velocity. Each feature (auth, delivery, feedback, profile, etc.) is modularized, encapsulating all logic, routes, controllers, and services. This enables:
- Effortless onboarding for new developers
- Rapid feature expansion
- Clean, organized codebase
- Easy testing and refactoring

We rigorously apply **SOLID** and **DRY** principles, resulting in:
- Highly reusable and testable code
- Minimal duplication
- Clear separation of concerns
- Future-proof extensibility
